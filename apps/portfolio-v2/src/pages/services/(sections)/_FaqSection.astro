            I provide tailored contracts with specific clauses to meet your
            requirements. Additionally, I am open to signing a Non-Disclosure
            Agreement (NDA) if needed. I fully understand the importance of

            discuss and incorporate these aspects into a mutually agreed-upon
            contract.

        >
            Yes, I am experienced and comfortable working with existing
            codebases. I can adapt quickly, understand the structure, and
            contribute effectively to ongoing projects. If they project is not

            course of action.

            Typically, the ownership of code and intellectual property (IP) is

            terms.
