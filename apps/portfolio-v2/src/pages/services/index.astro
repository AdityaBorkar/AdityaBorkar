    /* WHY SHOULD I WORK WITH YOU?
Just think of me as your creative bestie. 👯 As a business owner myself, I understand that you can’t do it all. I want to take all things “design” off your plate so you can focus on what you do best. I only work with a handful of clients at a time so that I’m able to dedicate the time and care needed to do my best work.
// You feel comfortable jumping into complex topics immediately
  // Good understanding of APIs and how to properly build them for long-term success
  // A self-starter who works well independently as well as interdependently in a remote environment
  // A motivated person who enjoys working on complex technical problems who does not need to be micro-managed
  // Someone who is looking to grow with us and our product
  
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
It really depends on how many emails you need designed. The process, on average, can take 2-6 weeks, from project start to implementation.

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
Well, every project can be unique so I like the quote that way too. Please get in touch and you’ll receive a short PDF with my packages and pricing.

WHAT PLATFORMS DO YOU WORK WITH?
I mainly work in Klaviyo (I’m Klaviyo product certified!), but I’m also comfortable with Mailchimp, Omnisend, Attentive, Salesforce, and more. 

CAN I EDIT THE EMAIL TEMPLATES YOU CREATE?
All my email templates are a combination of imagery and live text. I provide all design files in a program called Figma (it’s free for you) so you will be able to make any edits to images yourself after the project is done. I try to address any edits/changes during the one round of revisions during the project, so hopefully you won’t have to make any future edits!

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO GET STARTED?
Please check out my services page where I outline the creative process in more detail. To get started, I will need any brand assets (logos, fonts, imagery, etc) and an outline of the copy that needs to be included for each email.

CAN YOU WRITE COPY FOR ME?
No. This needs to be provided by you before I can start design. 

DO YOU IMPLEMENT OUR EMAIL MARKETING STRATEGY, TOO?
No. I can help with implementing and suggesting basic email flows + implementations. Any advanced email marketing strategies or flows will be implemented by you.
