    <Heading>How did I discover Tech?</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      Technology has always fascinated me—not just for what it is, but for what
      it can do to transform lives. At 14, I built my first HTML-JS solution to
      automate my dad's business, reducing man-hours by a staggering 80%. That
      small success fueled my passion, pushing me to learn PHP and MySQL to
      build more robust software. Starting with my family, I semi-automated our
      traditional transportation business. I also had the privilege of working
      with the Raspberry Pi Foundation on the NTTT and Translation Programme,
      helping make computing accessible to underprivileged children. As I
      explored further, I picked up Python to automate invoice generation for
      our family business, eventually moving 80% of its processes online.
      exploring Java, Python, PHP, C++, and JavaScript. JavaScript, in
      particular, felt revolutionary—it empowered me to build beautiful,
      high-performance user interfaces and ship cross-platform apps within days.
      With the rise of PWAs and cutting-edge web capabilities, I chose to
      specialize in Software Engineering on the Web. I landed my first gig for a
      US based client when I was 17. At the age of 19, I took a brief break to
      explore and specialize in product development and customer experience.

    <Heading>My journey towards Product Engineer</Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      My passion for product development stems from the joy of creating. I
      started working on products that I wanted to use daily (like a second
      brain, etc - check my projects). The process of creating led me to
      discover the field. Now, The joy of creating exceptional products is what
      drives me.
