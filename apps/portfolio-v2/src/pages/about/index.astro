      I engineer interfaces, products, and systems, from early concepts to
      full-fledged products, by partnering closely with designers, research, and
      engineering peers. I have done a bit of everything from branding, web
      design, copywriting, UX, design systems, and design engineering. My goal
      is to use technology to help people thrive in their work. Spending a lot
      of time digging into engineers&#x2019; heads and passionate about how
      software and methods can impact the outcomes of our work, I progressively
      shifted my focus from design systems to developer experience, which later
      led me to joining Linear in late 2023.

    <p class="mt-4 text-pretty text-base text-text-secondary max-md:text-sm">
      I discovered about CODE University, Berlin and got admitted but could not
      join it due to Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of defering education, I planned
      to continue to learn online and build my own career in tech. While
      exploring different languages - Java, Python, PHP, C++ and others; I
      struck upon JavaScript, it powered me to create beautiful user interfaces
      and ship to multiple devices cross-platforms easily within days. With the
      rising popularity of PWAs and new features coming in the web, I decided to
      pursue Web Software Engineering as a career.
