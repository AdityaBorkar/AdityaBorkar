Tips for Presentation
Keep it concise but detailed enough to showcase depth.
Use visuals to break up text.
Focus on outcomes over technical jargon.
Tailor case studies to roles you’re targeting (e.g., emphasize APIs for backend-heavy jobs).
By structuring your case studies this way, you’ll demonstrate your technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and ability to deliver real-world solutions.
