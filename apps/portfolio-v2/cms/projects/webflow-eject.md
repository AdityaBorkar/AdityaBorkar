## Problem Statement

A client owns around 10 Webflow Projects. The Webflow costs of operating those projects were quite a lot (USD 230 - 390 per month). The client ideated to create a SaaS product that can convert Webflow projects to Astro.js on click on "Publish" button. The product must sync the data from Webflow. CMS can be replaced by any open-source CMS solution.

The client wanted to create a MVP product and test the market.
