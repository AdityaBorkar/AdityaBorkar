## Problem Statement

A solo-developer created a website for an agency. Later, the solo-developer left the agency and the website was half-complete. I was hired to solve the crisis - complete the website, optimize it, build additional features, and take it to market as soon as possible.

## Solution

The existing code was not following the best practices. I made the following changes:

- A new repository was created in GitHub. It was linked with Vercel for auto-deployments.
- Linting and formatting rules were added.
- The repository was re-configured to use Typescript instead of Javascript
- Type Checks and Linting rules were re-enabled.
- The website was optimized for build-time static pages and incremental static regeneration (ISR).
- Existing code was refactored to follow the best practices.
- Next.js and React were updated to the latest versions.
- The design was updated to match the design file handed over by the client.
- Form submissions were synced with Google Sheets (as a backend database).
- New pages and endpoints were added to the website.
- The website was deployed on Vercel.
- Website Content was updated with the latest information.

Along with the above changes, a high-level vulnerability was detected. The previous developer had EXPOSED the API Secrets of Google Sheets API. I rotated the keys and refactored the code to avoid such vulnerabilities.

After completion of the project, I submitted a website report that advised the agency for further improvements and upgradation to the website. However, the agency was very happy with the work done and denied the need for further improvements.

## Results

- New Website driving 5000+ visitors per month and 100+ leads per month.
- Modern Next.js Website that is fast, secure, and scalable, easier to maintain and extend.
- Instead of writing new code, existing code was refactored to follow the best practices. The website was handed over in 3 days (along with iterations).
- Knowledge Transfer was done to new developers who joined the agency.
