## Problem Statement

Using forms have become simpler over time by some of the great libraries - Tanstack Forms and React Hook Forms. But, the amount of code that needs to be written becomes immense in a larger form. To solve this sole problem and enhance the developer experience to the next level, we decided to build a library.

## Unique Features

- Common API for both libraries
- Component Library Integration
- Rendering based on conditions:
  <Form.Div if={condition}>

## Result

- Open Source Form Library that will help developers build complex forms in less time.
