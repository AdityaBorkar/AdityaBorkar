## Problem Statement

While using SST, it is a great developer experience, but it lacks  certain functionality from Vercel that makes it less attractive soluton for working as a solo developer. To solve this, I create a CI/CD Pipeline in a GitHub App that can manage this thing.

## Key Features Implemented

- GitHub bot that responds to pull requests
-

## Features Planned for Future:

- MCP Server
-

## Result

- Used in 3 in-house projects. It was a part of the in-house development templates, but we eventually switched back to Vercel while expanding the development team to multiple members.
- The library was later merged with the "Hooop Cloud" project.
- Reduced dependency on proprietory software
