          <Accordian label='How do you charge?'>
            I charge on hourly rates payable on milestone-basis. I ask for 40%
            upfront payment. I support the following currencies - USD, EUR, GBP,
            AUD, CAD, SGD, INR
          </Accordian>
          <Accordian label='What timezones do you work in?'>
            I am flexible to work in any timezone. Based upon my ongoing
            projects, I shall convey my availability when we discuss the project
            proposal.
          </Accordian>
          <Accordian label='Who owns the code that you write?'>
            I push the code to the GitHub Repository you own. Publishing is
            configured with a CI/CD Pipeline wherever possible. Once the project
            is completed, all the intellectual rights and ownership shall be
            transferred to you.
          </Accordian>
          <Accordian label='Do you offer maintainence and post-project support?'>
            Yes! I offer maintainence and post-project support. I also offer a
            30 day warranty period for any bugs or issues that may arise after
            the project is completed.
          </Accordian>
          <Accordian label='Do you offer Confidentiality Contracts?'>
            Yes! I offer Contracts with specific clauses as per requirements. I
            am also open to signing an NDA if required. I understand the
            importance of Project Privacy and Confidentiality. I am open to
            discuss about this and include it in a contract that we both agree
            upon.
          </Accordian>
          <Accordian label='Do you work in teams? How do you collaborate?'>
            Communication and Collaboration: They might ask about the preferred
            communication channels, frequency of updates, and availability for
            meetings or discussions.
          </Accordian>
          <Accordian label='Can you scale if the requirements grow?'>
            Scalability and Flexibility: Questions about the developer's ability
            to scale the team if needed or adapt to changing project
            requirements.
          </Accordian>
          {/* WHY SHOULD I WORK WITH YOU?
Just think of me as your creative bestie. üëØ As a business owner myself, I understand that you can‚Äôt do it all. I want to take all things ‚Äúdesign‚Äù off your plate so you can focus on what you do best. I only work with a handful of clients at a time so that I‚Äôm able to dedicate the time and care needed to do my best work.
// You feel comfortable jumping into complex topics immediately
  // Good understanding of APIs and how to properly build them for long-term success
  // A self-starter who works well independently as well as interdependently in a remote environment
  // A motivated person who enjoys working on complex technical problems who does not need to be micro-managed
  // Someone who is looking to grow with us and our product
  
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
It really depends on how many emails you need designed. The process, on average, can take 2-6 weeks, from project start to implementation.

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
Well, every project can be unique so I like the quote that way too. Please get in touch and you‚Äôll receive a short PDF with my packages and pricing.

WHAT PLATFORMS DO YOU WORK WITH?
I mainly work in Klaviyo (I‚Äôm Klaviyo product certified!), but I‚Äôm also comfortable with Mailchimp, Omnisend, Attentive, Salesforce, and more. 

CAN I EDIT THE EMAIL TEMPLATES YOU CREATE?
All my email templates are a combination of imagery and live text. I provide all design files in a program called Figma (it‚Äôs free for you) so you will be able to make any edits to images yourself after the project is done. I try to address any edits/changes during the one round of revisions during the project, so hopefully you won‚Äôt have to make any future edits!

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO GET STARTED?
Please check out my services page where I outline the creative process in more detail. To get started, I will need any brand assets (logos, fonts, imagery, etc) and an outline of the copy that needs to be included for each email.

CAN YOU WRITE COPY FOR ME?
No. This needs to be provided by you before I can start design. 

DO YOU IMPLEMENT OUR EMAIL MARKETING STRATEGY, TOO?
No. I can help with implementing and suggesting basic email flows + implementations. Any advanced email marketing strategies or flows will be implemented by you.
